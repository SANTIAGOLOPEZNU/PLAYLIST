        <h2>Viva la vida</h2>

        <p>I used to rule the world<br>
            Seas would rise when I gave the word<br>
            Now in the morning I sleep alone<br>
            Sweep the streets I used to own</p>

        <p>I used to roll the dice<br>
            Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes<br>
            Listened as the crowd would sing:<br>
            "Now the old king is dead, long live the king"</p>

        <p>One minute I held the key<br>
            Next the walls were closed on me<br>
            And I discovered that my castles stand<br>
            Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand</p>

        <p>I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing<br>
            Roman cavalry choirs are singing<br>
            Be my mirror my sword and shield<br>
            My missionaries in a foreign field</p>

        <p>For some reason I can't explain<br>
            Once you'd gone there was never<br>
            Never an honest word<br>
            That was when I ruled the world</p>

        <p>It was the wicked and wild wind<br>
            Blew down the doors to let me in<br>
            Shattered windows and the sound of drums<br>
            People couldn't believe what I'd become</p>

        <p>Revolutionaries wait<br>
            For my head on a silver plate<br>
            Just a puppet on a lonely string<br>
            Oh who would ever want to be king?</p>

        <p>I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing<br>
            Roman cavalry choirs are singing<br>
            Be my mirror my sword and shield<br>
            My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
            For some reason I can't explain<br>
            I know Saint Peter won't call my name<br>
            Never an honest word<br>
            But that was when I ruled the world</p>

        <p>I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing<br>
            Roman cavalry choirs are singing<br>
            Be my mirror my sword and shield<br>
            My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
            For some reason I can't explain<br>
            I know Saint Peter won't call my name<br>
            Never an honest word<br>
            But that was when I ruled the world</p>
