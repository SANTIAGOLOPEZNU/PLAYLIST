        <h2>Hymn for the Weekend</h2>

        <p>Drink from me, drink from me (oh-ah-oh-ah)<br>
            Then we'll shoot across the (symphony)<br>
            Then we'll shoot across the sky<br>
            Drink from me, drink from me (oh-ah-oh-ah)<br>
            Then we'll shoot across the (oh-ah-oh-ah)<br>
            Symphony<br>
            (So high, so high)<br>
            Then we'll shoot across the sky</p>

        <p>Oh, angels sent from up above<br>
            You know you make my world light up<br>
            When I was down, when I was hurt<br>
            You came to lift me up<br>
            Life is a drink, and love's a drug<br>
            Oh now I think I must be miles up<br>
            When I was hurt, withered, dried up<br>
            You came to rain a flood</p>

        <p>So drink from me, drink from me<br>
            When I was so thirsty<br>
            We're on a symphony<br>
            Now I just can't get enough<br>
            Put your wings on me, wings on me<br>
            When I was so heavy<br>
            We're on a symphony<br>
            When I'm lower, lower, lower, low</p>

        <p>Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah<br>
            Got me feeling drunk and high<br>
            So high, so high<br>
            Oh-ah-oh-ah-oh-ah<br>
            I'm feeling drunk and high<br>
            So high, so high<br>
            (Woo)<br>
            (Woo-ooo-ooo-woo)</p>

        <p>Oh, angels sent from up above<br>
            I feel it coursing through my blood<br>
            Life is a drink, your love's about<br>
            To make the stars come out</p>

        <p>Put your wings on me, wings on me<br>
            When I was so heavy<br>
            We're on a symphony<br>
            When I'm lower, lower, lower, low</p>

        <p>Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah<br>
            Got me feeling drunk and high<br>
            So high, so high<br>
            Oh-ah-oh-ah-oh-ah<br>
            I'm feeling drunk and high<br>
            So high, so high</p>

        <p>Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah<br>
            La, la, la, la, la, la, la<br>
            So high, so high<br>
            Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah<br>
            I'm feeling drunk and highbr<br>
            So high, so high</p>

        <p>Then we'll shoot across the sky<br>
            Then we'll shoot across the<br>
            Then we'll shoot across the sky<br>
            Then we'll shoot across the (then we'll shoot)<br>
            Then we'll shoot across the sky<br>
            Then we'll shoot across the<br>
            Then we'll shoot across the sky<br>
            Then we'll shoot across the</p>
