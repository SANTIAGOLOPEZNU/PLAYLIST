        <h2>Something Just Like This</h2>

        <p>I've been reading books of old<br>
            The legends and the myths<br>
            Achilles and his gold<br>
            Hercules and his gifts<br>
            Spiderman's control<br>
            And Batman with his fists<br>
            And clearly I don't see myself upon that list</p>

        <p>
            But she said, where'd you want to go?<br>
            How much you want to risk?<br>
            I'm not looking for somebody<br>
            With some superhuman gifts<br>
            Some superhero<br>
            Some fairytale bliss<br>
            Just something I can turn to<br>
            Somebody I can kiss<br>
            I want something just like this<br>
            Oh, I want something just like this<br>
            Oh, I want something just like this<br>
            I want something just like this</p>

        <p>I've been reading books of old<br>
            The legends and the myths<br>
            The testaments they told<br>
            The moon and its eclipse<br>
            And Superman unrolls<br>
            A suit before he lifts<br>
            But I'm not the kind of person<br>
            That it fits</p>

        <p>But she said, where'd you want to go?<br>
            How much you want to risk?<br>
            I'm not looking for somebody<br>
            With some superhuman gifts<br>
            Some superhero<br>
            Some fairytale bliss<br>
            Just something I can turn to<br>
            Somebody I can kiss<br>
            I want something just like this<br>
            I want something just like this<br>
            Oh, I want something just like this<br>
            Oh, I want something just like this<br>
