        <h2>Yellow</h2>

        <p>Look at the stars<br>
            Look how they shine for you<br>
            And everything you do<br>
            Yeah, they were all yellow</p>

        <p>I came along<br>
            I wrote a song for you<br>
            And all the things you do<br>
            And it was called Yellow</p>

        <p>So then I took my turn<br>
            Oh, what a thing to have done<br>
            And it was all yellow</p>

        <p>your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones<br>
            (Ooh) turn into something beautiful<br>
            (Ah) and you know, you know I love you so<br>
            You know I love you so</p>

        <p>I swam across<br>
            I jumped across for you<br>
            Oh, what a thing to do<br>
            'Cause you were all yellow</p>

        <p>I drew a line<br>
            I drew a line for you<br>
            Oh, what a thing to do<br>
            And it was all yellow</p>

        <p>And your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones<br>
            (Ooh) turn into something beautiful<br>
            (Ah) and you know, for you, I'd bleed myself dry<br>
            For you, I'd bleed myself dry</p>

        <p>It's true<br>
            Look how they shine for you<br>
            Look how they shine for you<br>
            Look how they shine for...<br>
            Look how they shine for you<br>
            Look how they shine for you<br>
            Look how they shine</p>

        <p>Look at the stars<br>
            Look how they shine for you<br>
            And all the things that you do</p>
